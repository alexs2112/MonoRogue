**Roadmap:**
 * Different tile variants to make it a little more visually interesting
    * Maybe even floor tiles

 * Equipment
    * No inventory, when you stand over an item you will be prompted somewhere to equip it with space
    * Update the player glyph based on equipment

 * Screen to inspect creatures, items
    * Right click them

 * Ranged Attacks
    * Mousing over an enemy will draw a line to them, clicking them will attack them

 * An actual win condition
    * Have a start and end room in the dungeon
    * Reflavour the dungeon as an actual dungeon, guards trying to keep you in, you win when you escape
    * Food should be harder to come by

 * Animations for movement, combat and deaths
    * Movement and attacks can store an X and Y offset to creatures, when an animation is playing you just rapidly change the offset
    * This requires redoing the worldview
    * Don't take player input while an animation is playing, an option to turn it off in the settings (disable animations)

 * Refine dungeon generation
    * Locked doors that require keys to open
    * You should never get stuck without any keys but with more locked doors
    * Coloured keys, need to get 3 keys in order to leave essentially, each key is held by a tougher guard

 * Resize the screen size, although the 800 x 480 terminal is growing on me

 * Music and sound effects

 * Screenshots, Itch page

 * Release!
