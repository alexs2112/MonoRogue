### **Roadmap:**
 * Dungeon balance overhaul
    * Reflavour the dungeon as an actual dungeon, guards trying to keep you in, you win when you escape
    * We can probably estimate damage by depth and spawn food at points where it will be needed
    * Doors: Cannot be closed again, can handle it as a tile that turns into a floor when bumped into by the player

 * Refine dungeon generation
    * Locked doors that require keys to open
    * You should never get stuck without any keys but with more locked doors
    * Coloured keys, need to get 3 keys in order to leave essentially, each key is held by a tougher guard

 * Resize the screen size, although the 800 x 480 terminal is growing on me

 * Music and sound effects

 * Settings screen with persistent settings

 * Screenshots, Itch page

 * **Release!**
