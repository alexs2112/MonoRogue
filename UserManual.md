# MonoRogue

**Welcome to the dungeon!** Your goal is to explore the randomly generated world, collecting items, defeating enemies, and eventually making it to the exit. This user manual is a help document to explain some of the concepts that you will need to know in order to survive. The game is meant to be short and simple, with a reasonable amount of depth to it.

## Controls:
 - Arrow keys, Left Click, Numpad, or Vi Keys to move and attack
 - Spacebar or click yourself to interact with items on the ground
 - Right click creatures or items to see their stats
 - [s] to see your own stats
 - [r] to rest and repair armor
 - [.] to wait one turn
 - [/] or [?] to show the help menu
 - [esc] to quit the game or exit subscreens

## Weapons:
There are 6 different weapon types that you can equip. Each functions slightly differently to add some variety to gameplay.
* Swords deal higher damage than other weapons of its level
* Spears have increased range. Moving towards an enemy lets you "lunge" and get a free attack
* Axes hit all enemies adjacent to you whenever you attack
* Daggers lower your attack delay and can critically hit
* Maces deal additional damage to armor
* Bows have extended range but deal a little less damage
