# MonoRogue

**Welcome to the dungeon!** Your goal is to explore the randomly generated world, collecting items, defeating enemies, and eventually making it to the exit. This user manual is a help document to explain some of the concepts that you will need to know in order to survive. The game is meant to be short and simple, with a reasonable amount of depth to it.

## Weapons:
There are 6 different weapon types that you can equip. Each functions slightly differently to add some variety to gameplay.
* Swords deal higher damage than other weapons of its level
* Spears have increased range. Moving towards an enemy lets you "lunge" and get a free attack
* Axes hit all enemies adjacent to you whenever you attack
* Daggers lower your attack delay and can critically hit
* Maces deal additional damage to armor
* Bows have extended range but deal a little less damage

## Armor:
Armor has two stats: Defense and Weight. 

Defense serves to increase player survivability in the form of Blue Hearts. Blue hearts function similarly to regular hearts, but they regenerate outside of combat. 

Armor weight slows your movement and attack speed by increasing your move delay and attack delay. Heavier armor has higher defense, but also tends to have higher weight.
